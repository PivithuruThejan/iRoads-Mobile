Andoid application fr data gathering using smartphone sensors and OBD adapters.
Measuring and monitoring road conditions are essential to ensure public and vehicle safety, promptly maintenance, as well as fuel and time savings. While developed countries use advanced devices installed on specialized vehicles to measure and monitor road conditions, it is cost prohibitive for countries like Sri Lanka. Moreover, diversity of road types, non-standard physical properties, and conditions make them impractical for specialized vehicles to travel on roads in Sri Lanka and many other countries. For example, some roads are not wide enough to drive vehicles except for three-wheelers or motor bicycles. With the advancement of mobile devices and communication, we believe crowdsourcing with a suitable mobile app could measure the road conditions on a continual basis without advanced devices or vehicles. Therefore, anyone using a particular road segment, including three wheels and cyclists, can now collect and provide road condition data on a real-time basis giving a real-time view with a high spatial coverage. Hence our project goal is to develop a smartphone-based low-cost road condition monitoring and fuel consumption measuring application which suits to Sri Lankan roads.
